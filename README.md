Gemini

Python 3.x

requests library

pandas library

## Algorithm Overview

### **Step-by-Step Algorithm for Multi-AI Tool Integration**

1. **Set Up API Integrations**:
   - Install necessary libraries and set up the credentials for each AI tool: **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Gemini**.
   - Use `requests` or other relevant libraries for API integration.

2. **Input Healthcare Query**:
   - Accept healthcare-related data such as symptoms, medical history, and test results.

3. **Format Prompts**:
   - Three types of prompts will be used:
     - **Straightforward Prompt**: Asking for a diagnosis based on patient symptoms.
     - **Tabular Format**: Presenting data in a table format for structured input.
     - **Missing Word Prompt**: Providing a partially completed sentence for prediction.
   
4. **Submit Prompts to Each AI Tool**:
   - Send the formatted prompts to **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Gemini** APIs.

5. **Receive and Parse Responses**:
   - Collect and extract useful information such as diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

6. **Comparison of Outputs**:
   - Compare the responses based on **accuracy**, **clarity**, **simplicity**, and **user experience**.

7. **Generate Actionable Insights**:
   - Provide a summary of findings and suggest which tool performs best for specific types of queries.

8. **Create Final Report**:
   - Compile the results and insights into a comprehensive evaluation report.

## Code Implementation

### **Python Code Example for Integrating with Multiple AI Tools**

```python
import openai
import requests

# API Keys
CHATGPT_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
CLAUDE_API_KEY = "your_claude_api_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key"

# Initialize the OpenAI API (for ChatGPT)
openai.api_key = CHATGPT_API_KEY

# Function to get response from ChatGPT
def get_chatgpt_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",  # specify your model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to get response from Claude (Assume we are using a generic API)
def get_claude_response(prompt):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {CLAUDE_API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    payload = {'prompt': prompt}
    url = 'https://api.claude.ai/v1/complete'  # Example endpoint
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json().get('completion', '')

# Function to get response from Gemini (Assume we are using a generic API)
def get_gemini_response(prompt):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {GEMINI_API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    payload = {'prompt': prompt}
    url = 'https://api.gemini.ai/v1/generate'  # Example endpoint
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json().get('text', '')

# Example healthcare query (symptoms)
query = "Patient reports fever, cough, and shortness of breath. What could be the diagnosis and recommended action?"

# Send prompts to AI tools
chatgpt_response = get_chatgpt_response(query)
claude_response = get_claude_response(query)
gemini_response = get_gemini_response(query)

# Print the results
print("ChatGPT Response:")
print(chatgpt_response)

print("\nClaude Response:")
print(claude_response)

print("\nGemini Response:")
print(gemini_response)
```

## OUPUT RESPONSE
### **Functions for Getting Responses:**

1. **get_chatgpt_response():**
   - This function sends the healthcare query prompt to **ChatGPT** and retrieves the response.
   - It utilizes the OpenAI API (`openai.Completion.create`) to process the prompt and returns ChatGPT's response.

   ```python
   def get_chatgpt_response(prompt):
       response = openai.Completion.create(
           model="gpt-4",  # specify the model
           prompt=prompt,
           max_tokens=150
       )
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()

### **Functions for Getting Responses:**

2. **get_claude_response():**
   - This function sends the same healthcare query prompt to Claude using a hypothetical API (requests.post).
   - It returns Claude's response from the API call.

   ```python
    def get_claude_response(prompt):
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {CLAUDE_API_KEY}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        payload = {'prompt': prompt}
        url = 'https://api.claude.ai/v1/complete'  # Example endpoint
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        return response.json().get('completion', '')


### **Functions for Getting Responses:**

2. **get_gemini_response():**
   - This function sends the healthcare query to Gemini using a generic API endpoint and retrieves the response.
   - It processes the response from Gemini using requests.post.

   ```python
   def get_gemini_response(prompt):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {GEMINI_API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    payload = {'prompt': prompt}
    url = 'https://api.gemini.ai/v1/generate'  # Example endpoint
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json().get('text', '')

## Evaluation

The Python code evaluates the responses from **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Gemini** based on the following metrics:

### 1. **Accuracy**
   - **Definition**: This metric checks whether the response correctly identifies the diagnosis and suggests appropriate actions.
   - **Importance**: Ensuring accurate diagnostic suggestions is critical for healthcare applications.

### 2. **Coherence**
   - **Definition**: This metric assesses how logically structured and clear the response is.
   - **Importance**: Clear, well-structured responses make it easier for the user to understand the suggested diagnosis and actions.

### 3. **Simplicity**
   - **Definition**: This evaluates whether the response is easy to understand for the target audience (whether it's the general public or professionals).
   - **Importance**: Simplicity is essential for user comprehension, especially when dealing with complex healthcare information.

### 4. **User Experience**
   - **Definition**: This measures how well the response caters to the user, providing a clear and helpful solution.
   - **Importance**: A good user experience is vital for user engagement and decision-making, especially in critical situations like healthcare diagnostics.

```
import pandas as pd

# Sample evaluation data
evaluation_data = {
